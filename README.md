# kohrsupply

kohrsupply is a platform to accompany and manage relays of physical transportations. Its very alpha prototype for [ptarp](//github.com/klml/ptarp).

You should send things from Alice to Bob, but transported from Carol, stocked by Erin, again transported by Frank to Pagg and finaly delivered by Wendy.
